# Lending Club Case Study
 A consumer finance company specialises in lending various types of loans to urban customers. When the company receives a loan application, the company has to make a decision for loan approval based on the applicant’s profile. Two types of risks are associated with the bank’s decision:

    - If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, then not approving the loan results in a loss of business to the company
    
    - If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan, i.e. he/she is likely to default, then approving the loan may lead to a financial loss for the company

The aim is to identify patterns from the given dataset which indicate if a person is likely to default, which may be used for taking actions such as denying the loan, reducing the amount of loan, lending (to risky applicants) at a higher interest rate, etc. Using Exploratory Data Analysis, such loan applicants needs to be analysed and identify the driving factors (or driver variables) behind loan default, i.e. the variables which are strong indicators of default.

    * Charged-off: Applicant has not paid the instalments in due time for a long period of time, i.e. he/she has defaulted on the loan
